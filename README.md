## Use Cases (How to test)

* Which Web API did you use, and where is it being used in the application?
I used the Battery API. This API will check the battery percentage  on the device you are using and displays the percentage.

* What are application use cases?
 Since it uses an event listener, the percentage changes automatically without refreshing the page.

## Technical Write-up of selection of Web API selected:
The battery API is pretty sweet honestly, even though its not supported everywhere. It can tell what percent you are at.

## Self Reflection(s):
Learning this new API was sweet and it was a lot of fun to look at other APIs.

## How long it took me/us to finish this:
Around 2 hours I believe
